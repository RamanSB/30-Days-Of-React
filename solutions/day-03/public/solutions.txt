1) A module is a file ending with a .js file extension (JS file) that contains exports. These exports can then be imported as a module.

2) A package is a directory containing a single module or collection of modules, i.e. the React library is a package.

3) A package is a directory and a module is a file, a package also contains a package.json file.

4) NPM is the node package manager it is a tool that allows us to download and upload packages from / to the npm registry.

5) Webpack is a module bundler. It is primarily used to take JS modules/files with dependencies and generate static assets representing
those modules.

6) to create a new react project, we can use the node package executors (npx create-react-app react-project-dir-name)

7) when we execute npx create-react-app react-project, within our react-project directory, we have the following subdirectories:
    - node_modules
    - public
    - src 

we also have the following files: 
- package.json (Contains version information of the project as well as the node module dependencies our project has)
- README.md (Contains user defined information about the project)
- yarn-lock.json or package-lock.json (a fixed version of the package.json)

node_modules directory contains several subdirectorires for the dependencies required by our project.
public directory contains:
- a favicon.ico (used for the image shown in the browser tab for our app)
- index.html (the ONLY, single html file in the application where we import our JSX elements in to, via React DOM).
- robots.txt (used by webscrapers if our website is scrapable.)
- logo192.png
- logo512.png (images used in the default page shown when invoking create-react-app)

src directory contains:
- index.js
- index.html
- App.js
- App.css
- serviceWorker.js
- setUpTests.js
